First Discussion - Planned that we are going to be recreating the "Pre-order" button on bose.com. We discussed having contrasting colors and on hover, the colors would switch, alerting the user that they are hovering over it. Also, it needs to be able to adjust when the user changes the size of the window, along with accessbility features such as keyboard functionality.
